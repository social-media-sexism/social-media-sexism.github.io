      Facebook is a social media platform intended for people to be able to connect with their friends and families through posting and sharing statuses, pictures, and videos. Although it is presented as a harmless website for people to use for their leisure, there have been great patterns in women facing sexism on this social platform and even becoming addictive to the likes and comments they receive and basing their self worth on these numerical values.<br>

      The following video depicts 17 year old Khloe Rivera on the television show, Dr. Phil. Many Facebook users take their account’s statistics to determine the value of themselves which leads to negative impacts on their self esteem. She has called herself into the show to express her concern for her addiction to her phone, and social media, and so she can fulfill her desire of becoming “normal”. In her interview, she states that if she gets a certain number of likes on her Facebook pictures of herself, her self esteem rises and she is content. But, if her likes don’t reach that specific number, her self esteem drops. Depending on a number to value self worth only shows the negative impact such social media has on women to the extent where their vulnerability can be mistaken as high self esteem. <br><br>

      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ztwtFxyR3hs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>

      There have been surveys taken on 881 college women with the average age of 24 that use Facebook. Of these women, about 86% wanted to lose weight which is 61% higher than the results of the same survey taken by American women who primarily don’t use Facebook. This survey represents just the beginning to a larger problem women face on Facebook. <br><br>

      The reason women and girls face self esteem issues when using social medias such as Facebook is due to the way they are forced to present themselves. There is a clear double standard regarding men and women on social media where women face more self esteem issues. This is the direct result of the normalization of the objectification of women. By normalizing high standards for women, especially by men, women have the need to fulfill the expectations and when they don’t acquire the results they want, the women’s self esteems may drop.<br><br>

      Many of the negative comments and reactions women receive are from men, and are posted publicly, while others are privately messaged. This causes traditional misogynistic views to be perpetuated against women, which leads to many controversies on the topic of whether or not men are the reason for women to be negatively affected by social medias such as Facebook.<br><br>

      Facebook statuses are posted to give updates, tell stories, and express opinions. When Dario Maestripieri, a biologist, posted his opinions on the women he saw at the Conference of the Society for Neuroscience in New Orleans, he left lasting effects on women in the field due to the fact he called them “unattractive” and not of the “supermodel type”, insinuating that his profession is at a great disadvantage. By doing so, Maestripieri objectifies women by only viewing and valuing them by their attractiveness. The women who view this status can clearly get hurt by this message, which may cause the plunge of their self esteem. <br><br>

      One of the many women affected by sexist Facebook direct messages is Jogitha Josey. On February 7, 2017, Josey had received messages from a man she has never spoken to before stating,  “plz get married soon before 23 how old r u now. Why do you need more time”. The following images shows the conversation between the two:<br><br>

These messages show the misogynistic and patriarchal views that many men still have and are perpetuating onto women through social media. By stating women must be a certain age to be married in order to correctly “satisfy” men, the man makes it clear his intentions are based off of his objectification of women and how they don’t have a choice when it comes to marriage.<br><br>

	With these views put onto women, there are clear lasting effects that may take a toll on many women’s self esteem. Josey stated, “This person believes he somehow has the holy right to tell women on social media what is the right age to get married, something that he further goes on to explain, is for scientific reasons (did I feel harassed or what?!).” She describes herself to feel harassed since she was attacked by a random man online, and after she addressed him being sexist, she got attacked even more by “ invading [her] privacy, threatening [her], violating [her] personal space and dignity” (Josey). <br><br>

Many people may think it is not social media’s fault for situations like these. They put the blame on those sending these messages and portray women as sensitive for taking these “troll” messages or posts seriously. But in reality, women are affected negatively since it is so common and there are cases even worse than Josey’s. Whether it be cyber stalking or harassment, Facebook regulations should protect women and take down any person’s account that violates these regulations.<br><br>

	Josey went on to express her disappointment in Facebook regulations since she was unable to report the messager’s account and instead Facebook only gave her the option to block him. This leads to another great issue on Facebook reinforcing sexism. Although Facebook removes any posts that violates its regulations against hate speech which includes attack a person based on their “race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or medical condition”, there have been instances where they didn’t acknowledge posts clearly attacking women for their gender/sex to have violated these regulations. The following image depicts a clearly inappropriate image being reported, but not taken down:<br>
  <img src = "imgs/yt1.png" style="width:25%;"><br><br>
  This unfair situation was noticed by three women:  Laura Bates – the British 26-year-old founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, US writer Soraya Chemaly and Jaclyn Friedman – the American creator of Women, Action & the Media. These women were given many opinions for bringing attention to Facebook not taking actions on sexist and demeaning posts and comments written for women. These included them being criticized and told their protests were done by three women “who just don’t have a sense of humour” about a few bits of “laddish banter”. By telling these women they are making a big deal out of “jokes” critics are supporting the idea of the normalization of the sharing of images and “jokes” of sexual violence, domestic violence and rape. Bates states, ““These incredibly graphic and upsetting images were popping up everywhere. They were becoming prolific. We had parents get in touch telling us their children had seen images of little girls with black eyes in their News Feeds. They were appearing in Facebook Groups – which had nothing to do with women or violence – such as an Atheist Group… What was happening was a normalisation of these types of images across Facebook. And while Facebook executives kept telling us that the site had to allow people freedom of speech – what they didn’t account for was how these images were stifling other women’s freedom of expression – as they left the site distressed and speechless.”  Bates’ stance on this topic shows the general impression of many people on this topic. Starting from harassing and demeaning women, these posts branch out to other inappropriate topics which lead to the normalization of them. Not only are these posts upsetting, but they can take a toll on people.
